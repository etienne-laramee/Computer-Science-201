# Binary Search Tree Program
## Overview
This Java application implements a Binary Search Tree (BST) that allows users to:

Create a binary search tree with default values (1 to 7) while keeping it balanced.
- Add new nodes to the tree.
- Delete existing nodes from the tree.
- Display the tree nodes using the following traversal methods:
    - InOrder Traversal (Left → Root → Right)
    - PreOrder Traversal (Root → Left → Right)
    - PostOrder Traversal (Left → Right → Root)
- Exit the program.
